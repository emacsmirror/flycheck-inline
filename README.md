This is an extension for [Flycheck][]. It implements a minor-mode for displaying
errors from Flycheck right below their reporting location, using overlays.

It also supports displaying *related errors* from Flycheck checkers that support
them.  Here is an example of this behavior for Rust borrowing errors:

(See also [flycheck-rust][flycheck-rust] for automatically setting up your Rust
projects for Flycheck)

## Installation

Add `flycheck-inline.el` somewhere to your `load-path` and add the following to
your init file:

```emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'flycheck
  (add-hook 'flycheck-mode-hook #'flycheck-inline-mode))
```

This will turn on inline errors in all buffers where Flycheck is activated.

You can enable `flycheck-inline` in a subset of languages supported by Flycheck
by conditionally enabling `flycheck-inline-mode` in the hook above, since the
mode is buffer-local.

Alternatively, if you do not use the setup above, you can use the command
`global-flycheck-inline-mode` to enable `flycheck-inline-mode` in all current
and future Flycheck buffers.

## Configuration

The colors used to display the error/warning/info messages are inherited from
the compilation faces.  You can customize them through `M-x customize-group RET
flycheck-inline RET`.

If you wish to change the delay before errors are displayed, see
`flycheck-display-errors-delay`.

You can change the way overlays are created by customizing
`flycheck-inline-display-function` and `flycheck-inline-clear-function`.  Here
is an example using [quick-peek][] to display the overlays which adds bars
around them:

```emacs-lisp
(setq flycheck-inline-display-function
      (lambda (msg pos)
        (let* ((ov (quick-peek-overlay-ensure-at pos))
               (contents (quick-peek-overlay-contents ov)))
          (setf (quick-peek-overlay-contents ov)
                (concat contents (when contents "\n") msg))
          (quick-peek-update ov)))
      flycheck-inline-clear-function #'quick-peek-hide)
```

The result:
